# tourism-demand-forecasting
Capstone project for demand forecasting and tourism analytics. Includes data exploration, time-series forecasting, and recommendation system development.

# Tourism Demand Forecasting – Data Science Project
This repository contains a full data-science workflow focused on forecasting restaurant item demand across multiple locations. The notebook walks through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and insights extraction — aligned with real business decision-making needs in the tourism 
and hospitality sector.

# The goal: enable data-driven forecasting that improves planning, inventory, staffing, and promotional strategy.
Project Overview
Tourism-driven businesses face volatile demand patterns influenced by seasonality, regional trends, holidays, and consumer behavior.

#This project provides:
A structured analysis of multi-restaurant sales data
Visual exploration of temporal demand patterns
Predictive modeling for future sales forecasting
Insights that support operational and strategic decisions
Everything is packaged in a single notebook for clarity and ease of review.

# Key Components
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding distribution, outliers, correlations, and time-based patterns.
✔ Feature Engineering
Creation of time-series features such as:
day-of-week, month, season, holidays, lag features, rolling averages.
✔ Forecasting Models
Models tested may include:
ARIMA
Prophet
XGBoost / RandomForest
LSTM (optional extension)

# Insights & Business Value
Sales planning
Inventory optimization
Staff allocation
Marketing alignment
